# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

- **Purpose:** Analyze sales data for business decision-making.
- **Tools Used:** Python for data analysis, Power BI for final visualizations.

In this project "Sales Data Analysis" I focused on extracting valuable insights from sales data to support data-driven decision-making. 
This analysis will help to uncover sales trends, identify top-selling products, and calculate essential revenue metrics.

## Project Components:

- Exploring sales trends over time, including monthly and hourly patterns.
- Visualizations (Power BI):
